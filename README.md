For Emily. An Android tip calculator of sorts, which finds palindrome tips that
give palindrome totals.

Building is done with the [SBT android
plugin](https://github.com/jberkel/android-plugin). It requires SBT 0.12.4 and
might not work with any other version, particularly 0.13. The simplest command
for building and launching the app is `sbt android:start-device`.
